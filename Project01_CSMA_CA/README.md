# Project01 CSMA-CA
Use Mento-Carlo simulation to demonstrate the average transmission efficiency versus the number of STAs in a BSS, where 

$$
\text{Transmission Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Time for Frame Transmission and Acknowledge}}{\text{Time for Frame Transmission+Overhead(SIFS,DIFS,contention)}}.
$$
